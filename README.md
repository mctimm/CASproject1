# CASproject1

This the is the README for the first project of Complex Adaptive Systems, which has the members Sean Timm, Abir Islam, and Matt Timm.

Currently, the only thing is a logisitic map which produces the two graphs for the first part of the assignment. I will try to have the code for part 2 done this evening (2/11).
