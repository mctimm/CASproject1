# CASproject1

This the is the README for the first project of Complex Adaptive Systems, which has the members Sean Timm, Abir Islam, and Matt Timm.
#Part 1.
The graphs for part 1 are created by running the LogisticMap.py script. Mutual information was calculated by plugging data directly into the JIDT tool. 

#Part 2.
The graphs for part 2 are created by running the logistic_map.py script to generate the data in the TEdata folder. Then running the TEcalc.m script in matlab to generated two CSV's. These are plotted using the PlotCI.m script for plotting the transfer entropy and MIcalc.m for the mutual information plot.
#Part 3
The first plot is created using the LogisticMapFrIt.py. The second two figures were generated using the https://rawgraphs.io/ tool with the data in the bin_data folder. The data in the bin folder was generated using counts_by_country.js, compare_country.py
